# Single_Tab
Single tab is an extension to close all the tabs in chrome Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the SingleTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list.
When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.  
When your tabs are in the SingleTab list, you will save up to 95% of memory because you will have reduced the number of open tabs.
